class SessionsController < ApplicationController

  # Create a SessionsController but no Session model.
  #   - Write controller methods and the accompanying routes so that users
  #     can log in and log out. Should session be a singular resource?
  #   - SessionsController#create should re-set the appropriate user's
  #     session_token and session[:session_token].
  #   - For now just redirect them to a User#show page which simply displays
  #     that user's email.
